            <h1>How they work</h1>
            <p>They use the sunlight to cast a shadow on the the pole like part called the gnomon The shadow is collected on a base called the dial
                which has many numbers, and depending on where the shadow
                is on the base, they can get a rough estimate of what time it is

            <h1>Origin</h1>
            <p>The sundial was found being used as early as 1500 BC in Egypt. These early sundials worked differently as they used the length of the shadow, not the location
                to find the time.
